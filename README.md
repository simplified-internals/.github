## About

This organization contains **hobby projects** where I recreate **popular JavaScript and Rust libraries** for learning and experimentation. These projects are **not intended to replace existing libraries**, but rather to explore their core ideas.

## Purpose

The focus is on **understanding over completeness**: minimal APIs, readable code, and clear structure. Everything here prioritizes learning, curiosity, and internal mechanics rather than production use.

## Contributing

Contributions, discussions, and suggestions are welcome-especially if you enjoy learning by rebuilding things or improving clarity through better code and documentation.
