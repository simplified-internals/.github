## 🤔 About 

This organization contains **hobby projects** where I recreate **popular JavaScript and Rust libraries** for learning and experimentation. These projects are **not intended to replace existing libraries**, but rather to explore their core ideas.

## 🛠️ Stuff
- [hooks_rs](https://github.com/simplified-internals/hooks_rs) - Rust implementation of react-fiber.
- [recrust](https://github.com/simplified-internals/recrust) - RSX parser. 
- [animr](https://github.com/simplified-internals/animr) - Utilities for linear interpolation, easings, and a centralized animation manager.
- [redux_rs](https://github.com/simplified-internals/redux_rs) - State manager.
